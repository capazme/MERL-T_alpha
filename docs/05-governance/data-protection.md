# Data Protection and Privacy

## 1. Commitment to Data Protection

MERL-T and the ALIS (Artificial Legal Intelligence Society) are deeply committed to protecting the privacy and personal data of all individuals who interact with the platform, including community members, users, and any individuals whose data may be part of the legal documents processed by the system. Our data protection strategy is designed to be fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws.

## 2. Data Processing Principles

We adhere to the core principles of data protection as outlined in Article 5 of the GDPR:

-   **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: All personal data will be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. The basis for processing will be clearly communicated to data subjects.
-   **Purpose Limitation**: Personal data will only be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes (e.g., managing community membership, calculating authority scores, conducting research) and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.
-   **Data Minimization**: We will only process personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed.
-   **Accuracy**: We will take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
-   **Storage Limitation**: Personal data will be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.
-   **Integrity and Confidentiality**: We will process personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

## 3. Data Subject Rights

MERL-T will provide clear and accessible mechanisms for data subjects to exercise their rights under GDPR, including:

-   **Right of Access**: Users will have the right to access their personal data and information about how it is being processed.
-   **Right to Rectification**: Users will have the right to have inaccurate personal data corrected without undue delay.
-   **Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten')**: Users will have the right to have their personal data erased under certain conditions.
-   **Right to Restrict Processing**: Users will have the right to obtain the restriction of processing in certain situations.
-   **Right to Data Portability**: Users will have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
-   **Right to Object**: Users will have the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances.

## 4. Data Security

We will implement a comprehensive set of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data, including:

-   **Pseudonymization and Encryption**: Where possible, personal data will be pseudonymized or encrypted to reduce the risks to the data subjects.
-   **Access Control**: Strict access control policies will be in place to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to personal data.
-   **Regular Security Assessments**: We will conduct regular risk assessments and security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
-   **Data Breach Response Plan**: A clear plan will be in place to respond to any potential data breaches in a timely and effective manner.

## 5. The Role of the ALIS Association

As the governing body of the MERL-T project, the **ALIS Association will act as the Data Controller** for the personal data processed by the platform. In this capacity, the association will be responsible for:

-   Ensuring and demonstrating compliance with the GDPR.
-   Appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if required.
-   Conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing activities.
-   Serving as the primary point of contact for data subjects and supervisory authorities.

By embedding data protection principles into the core of the MERL-T architecture and governance model, we aim to build a platform that is not only powerful but also worthy of the trust of its users and the legal community.
