# The ALIS Association: Governance for MERL-T

## 1. Mission and Vision

**ALIS (Artificial Legal Intelligence Society)** is a non-profit association dedicated to the advancement of ethical, transparent, and effective AI in the legal domain. Our mission is to foster a collaborative ecosystem of legal and technology experts to build and govern artificial intelligence systems that serve the best interests of society and uphold the principles of justice.

Our vision is to guide the development of legal AI away from opaque, purely commercial models and towards open, community-driven frameworks that are accountable, transparent, and aligned with democratic values.

## 2. Role in the MERL-T Project

ALIS is the sponsoring and governing body for the MERL-T project. The association plays several critical roles:

1.  **Project Sponsorship**: ALIS provides the financial and organizational resources necessary to develop, maintain, and host the MERL-T platform.

2.  **Guardian of the RLCF Process**: The association is the ultimate authority for the Reinforcement Learning from Community Feedback (RLCF) framework. It sets the "constitutional principles" of the framework, ensures its ethical application, and oversees the community of expert validators.

3.  **Owner of the Collective Intellectual Asset**: The core intellectual property of the MERL-T project, particularly the trainable MoE Router and Synthesizer and the ever-evolving Knowledge Graph, is considered the "patrimonio intellettuale collettivo" (collective intellectual asset) of the association. This ensures that this critical technology remains under the control of the community and cannot be used for purposes that contradict the association's mission.

4.  **Community Management**: ALIS is responsible for recruiting, vetting, and managing the community of legal experts who participate in the RLCF process. This includes defining the criteria for expertise, managing the dynamic authority scores, and ensuring the health and diversity of the community.

## 3. Community and Membership

The strength of the RLCF framework lies in its community. The ALIS association is composed of a diverse group of members, including:

-   **Legal Professionals**: Lawyers, judges, and other practitioners from a wide range of specializations.
-   **Academics**: Legal scholars, computer scientists, and ethicists who provide theoretical and empirical rigor.
-   **Technologists**: AI developers, data scientists, and software engineers who build and maintain the MERL-T platform.

Membership is based on demonstrated expertise and a commitment to the association's mission. The community is the living embodiment of the RLCF's "Dynamic Authority" principle, where influence is earned through high-quality contributions to the ecosystem.

## 4. Governance Structure

ALIS is governed by a board of directors elected by its members. The board is responsible for:

-   Setting the strategic direction of the association and the MERL-T project.
-   Appointing a technical steering committee to oversee the development of the platform.
-   Establishing and enforcing the ethical guidelines and constitutional principles of the RLCF framework.
-   Ensuring the financial and operational health of the association.

This governance structure ensures that the MERL-T project remains aligned with its core mission and accountable to the community it serves.
