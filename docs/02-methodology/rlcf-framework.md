# The RLCF Framework: A Methodology for Principled Legal AI

**Reinforcement Learning from Community Feedback (RLCF)** is the core methodology that powers the MERL-T architecture. It is a novel AI alignment framework specifically designed to address the unique epistemological challenges of the legal domain, providing a transparent, verifiable, and collaborative approach to building trustworthy Artificial Legal Intelligence (ALI) systems.

This document provides a high-level overview of the RLCF framework. For a complete and detailed explanation of the mathematical foundations, algorithmic implementation, and technical architecture, please refer to the comprehensive documentation in the `rlcf` subdirectory.

## Core Motivation

Traditional AI alignment methods like RLHF fall short in the legal field. RLCF was created to address these shortcomings by focusing on four key requirements of legal reasoning:

-   **Epistemic Pluralism**: Recognizing that multiple valid legal interpretations can coexist.
-   **Dynamic Authority**: Understanding that expertise is earned and evolves over time.
-   **Dialectical Preservation**: Maintaining and learning from productive disagreement among experts.
-   **Transparent Accountability**: Ensuring that all reasoning paths are clear, traceable, and auditable.

## The Four Pillars of RLCF

The RLCF framework is built on four foundational, or "constitutional," principles that are algorithmically embedded into the system:

1.  **Dynamic Authority (*Auctoritas Dynamica*)**: Authority is earned through demonstrated competence, not just credentials.
2.  **Preserved Uncertainty (*Incertitudo Conservata*)**: Disagreement among experts is treated as valuable information, not noise.
3.  **Transparent Process (*Processus Transparens*)**: All validation and aggregation steps are auditable and reproducible.
4.  **Universal Expertise (*Peritia Universalis*)**: Domain boundaries are emergent, and cross-domain insights are valued.

## Comprehensive Documentation

-   **[Technical Architecture](./rlcf/technical/)**: The overall system design, database schema, and configuration system.
-   **[API Reference](./rlcf/api/)**: A complete guide to the REST API endpoints and data schemas.
-   **[User Guides](./rlcf/guides/)**: Practical instructions for installation, configuration, and academic research.
-   **[Tutorials](./rlcf/tutorials/)**: Step-by-step guides for common tasks and advanced features.
-   **[Reference](./rlcf/reference/)**: A glossary of terms, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides.

By integrating its core principles directly into its mathematical and technical architecture, the RLCF framework provides a robust and principled foundation for the MERL-T project.
