**Reinforcement
Learning from Community Feedback (RLCF): A Novel Framework for Artificial
Intelligence in Social Science Domains**

**Abstract**

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs)
in high-stakes social science domains—including law, economics, sociology,
political science, and anthropology—presents a critical reliability crisis.
Traditional alignment methodologies, particularly Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF), prove inadequate for these fields as they introduce
subjective biases, lack epistemological rigor, and operate as opaque systems
that fail the transparency requirements essential to scientific inquiry and democratic
institutions. This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning from Community
Feedback (RLCF), a novel paradigm designed to ground Artificial Intelligence in
social science domains within a transparent, verifiable, and collaborative
framework. Our primary aim is to demonstrate how RLCF overcomes current
limitations by shifting from subjective preference optimization to
community-driven, objective validation. We argue that this approach not only
enhances the accuracy and reliability of AI in social sciences but also fosters
transformative pathways for knowledge management, education, and
interdisciplinary research across multiple domains of human society.

The RLCF framework employs a mathematically
grounded methodology that diverges significantly from traditional RLHF. Our
multi-faceted architecture captures the inherent complexity of social science
reasoning through four integrated components. First, the dynamic authority
scoring system revolutionizes expertise recognition in interdisciplinary
contexts. Unlike static annotator panels, RLCF implements a dynamic model where
contributor influence becomes a function of baseline credentials, historical
track record, and recent performance across domain-specific tasks. This ensures
expertise is continuously earned through demonstrated competence and peer
validation, creating a meritocratic ecosystem that rewards genuine domain
knowledge whether in empirical research, theoretical analysis, or applied
policy work.

Second, the framework addresses epistemic
pluralism through uncertainty-preserving aggregation. Recognizing that social
science reasoning involves multiple valid interpretations rooted in different
methodological and theoretical frameworks, we utilize an uncertainty-aware
aggregation algorithm based on normalized Shannon entropy. When expert
disagreement surpasses a configurable threshold, the system preserves and
structures this dissent as valuable epistemic information. This dialectical
preservation maintains the legitimate diversity of approaches characterizing
sophisticated analysis in fields where competing paradigms—whether quantitative
versus qualitative methodologies, structural versus agency-centered theories,
or macro versus micro perspectives—offer equally valid analytical frameworks.

Third, community-driven validation and governance
mechanisms operate through a modular architecture supporting diverse tasks
including data analysis, hypothesis testing, literature synthesis, and
predictive modeling. Feedback is collected from broad communities of
researchers, practitioners, and domain experts, ensuring multiple disciplinary
perspectives inform system development. The process is governed by transparent
constitutional principles embedded in the system's architecture, ensuring
updates remain aligned with foundational goals of scientific rigor,
methodological transparency, and interdisciplinary collaboration across all
social science applications.

Fourth, to counteract disciplinary silos and
methodological dogmatism, the framework incorporates a probabilistic Devil's
Advocate assignment model. This mechanism actively encourages challenging
dominant paradigms and methodological assumptions, strengthening the critical
evaluation process and ensuring even widely accepted theories undergo rigorous
interdisciplinary scrutiny.

While the RLCF framework is currently in the
architectural phase pending full-scale implementation, its design is grounded
in clear, testable hypotheses applicable across social sciences. We have
developed a comprehensive evaluation framework to measure performance against
traditional RLHF-based systems once deployed. We project that RLCF's unique
features will yield substantial improvements across key dimensions critical to
social science research.

Expected outcomes include significantly enhanced
analytical accuracy and methodological rigor across disciplines. Unlike RLHF
systems optimizing for plausibility or user preference, our model prioritizes
verifiable expertise and rigorous methodological reasoning whether applied to
econometric models, ethnographic interpretations, or sociological theories.
Performance will be measured against established benchmarks in each discipline,
where we expect RLCF to produce more nuanced analyses reflecting both empirical
complexity and theoretical sophistication. The framework should achieve
superior uncertainty calibration, establishing reliable correlation between
stated confidence and actual accuracy. By explicitly modeling expert
disagreement through uncertainty-aware aggregation, confidence levels will
better reflect the true epistemological status of social science questions,
acknowledging areas where disciplinary consensus exists alongside legitimate
methodological disputes.

Additionally, we anticipate substantial reduction
in systemic bias through proactive measures embedded in the system's design. We
expect significant decreases in bias scores when measured by our
multi-dimensional detection framework covering ideological, methodological,
cultural, and geographical biases. This improvement stems from the system's
transparency, diverse community feedback inclusion, and dialectical pressure
from cross-disciplinary challenge mechanisms.

The RLCF framework represents a paradigm shift in
AI alignment for social science domains. By incorporating social science
epistemology directly into its technical architecture, it creates pathways for
developing AI systems that are computationally powerful yet methodologically
rigorous and scientifically accountable. This approach opens new frontiers for
interdisciplinary research, evidence-based policy making, and democratizing
access to sophisticated analytical tools. We believe this research establishes
foundations for sustainable AI ecosystems in social sciences, creating digital
infrastructure that advances human understanding of society while respecting
the methodological pluralism inherent in social scientific inquiry.
